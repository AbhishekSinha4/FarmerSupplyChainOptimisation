## Farmer Supply Chain Optimisation

We aim to optimise the farmer supply chain in two phases..
First is by creating a demand forecast for various perishable goods at various markets of the city.
Second - using other factors such as cost of travel, the time taken to reach the market, etc.
We aim to keep the farmers as the primary stakeholder and provide them with the informed decision making ability they have lacked all these years.
